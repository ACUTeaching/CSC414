* steps for compression : 
	o first of all you have a dictionary that the sender and the reciever have agreed upon it and it's basically contains the different characters of your data and a code for each one the code can be the ASCII code for the character.
	o second while not end of file we keep reading the input string and we ask the following questions :
		# is the current character(s) plus the next(c) in the dictionary ?
			- yes :
				* then s equals s + c   
			- no :
 				* output the code for the current character(s) from the dictionary.
 				* add s + c to the dictionary with a new code.
 				* s equals c (the current in the next iteration will be the next)	


 	o output the code for the s (meaning that we reached the end of file and couldn't output the code because the loop has been ended)			



 	o in simple words : you keep concatenating characters from input till it's not in the dictionary then you add it to the dictionary and you output the code of the last sequence in the dictionary.





* steps for decompression : 
	o first of all you have a dictionary that the sender and the reciever have agreed upon it and it's basically contains the different characters of your data and a code for each one the code can be the ASCII code for the character.

	o s = NIL 
		- s is the current string of the compressed output(the code) in the dictionary ex:
			- A(the string) ,  1(the compressed output or code for A)
	o k => the compressed output(the code) 
	o entry => the next string of the compressed output(the code) in the dictionary
	o while not end of file output the entry and if s not null(not the first iteration) then add the s + entry[0] (first character of next) to the dictionary then s(current) will equal to entry(the next) for the next iteration. 



	o in simple words : we get the current string for the compressed output and the first character of the next and if it's not in the dictionary we add it and output the string of the current compressed output.




* tricky case of decompression : 
	o when the compressed output is not in the dictionary you get all symbols picked from previous step
and first Symbol picked from current step

	o ex : let's say that the current compressed output is 5 and we don't have 5 in dictionary and the previous was 4(AB)
	then current will be ABA(AB plus first character from current which is A)
